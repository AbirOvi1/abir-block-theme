# Abir Block Theme — Full Site Editing (FSE) Gutenberg Theme

**Abir Block Theme** is a lightweight, modern, and developer-friendly **Full Site Editing (FSE)** WordPress theme.  
It is built entirely with **Gutenberg Block Editor** — no traditional PHP templates required.

## How to Install and Use

2. In your WordPress dashboard, go to:  
   **Appearance → Themes → Add New → Upload Theme**  
3. Upload the ZIP file and **Activate** the theme

## Theme Concept

The **Abir Block Theme** is designed for modern WordPress developers who want to master the **Gutenberg ecosystem**.  
Every part of the theme is built using blocks —  
no `header.php`, `footer.php`, or `index.php` files needed.

Key ideas:
- 100% block-based design  
- JSON-driven global styles (`theme.json`)  
- Editable directly from WordPress Site Editor  
- Minimal, clean, and future-proof
